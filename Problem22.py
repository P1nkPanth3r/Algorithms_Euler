# Problem 22
# Using names.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 46K text file containing over five-thousand first names,
# begin by sorting it into alphabetical order. Then working out the alphabetical value for each name, multiply this value
# by its alphabetical position in the list to obtain a name score. For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical
# order, COLIN, which is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name in the list. So, COLIN would obtain a score
# of 938 Ã— 53 = 49714. What is the total of all the name scores in the file?
